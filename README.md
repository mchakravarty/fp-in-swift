This repository contains the supporting material for the workshop [Functional Programming in Swift](https://functionalconf.com/proposal.html?id=4054) to be held as part of [Functional Conf](https://functionalconf.com), Bangalore, 2017.

**Talks**

1. [Functional Programming in a Stateful World](https://github.com/mchakravarty/fp-in-swift/raw/master/talk-slides/FP-Stateful.pdf)
2. [A Type is Worth a Thousand Tests](https://github.com/mchakravarty/fp-in-swift/raw/master/talk-slides/one-type-thousand-tests.pdf)
3. [Do-It-Yourself Functional Reactive Programming](https://github.com/mchakravarty/fp-in-swift/raw/master/talk-slides/DIY-FRP.pdf)

The `Goals-EXERCISE` directory contains an exercise version of [Goals.app](https://github.com/mchakravarty/goalsapp), the running example from the second and third talk listed above.
